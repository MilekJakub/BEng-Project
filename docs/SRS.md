### Design and Implementation Constraints

The development and deployment of this application are subject to several constraints that could affect its design and 
implementation. These constraints are primarily related to system requirements, compliance standards, hardware 
limitations, and specific technologies employed in the project.

#### Frontend Technologies
React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS dictate a modern, component-based architecture for the front end.
This choice necessitates using browsers that support ES6 and later features, potentially limiting support for older
browser versions.

#### Mobile Support
The initial exclusion of mobile platforms could constrain user accessibility and market reach, necessitating a
responsive design approach to accommodate mobile devices.

#### Client Devices
The application's performance on client devices, especially in graphics and real-time features (Phaser, SignalR), may
vary based on the device's hardware capabilities, such as GPU and CPU performance.

#### Content Licensing
The use of third-party assets or code libraries necessitates adherence to licensing agreements, which may restrict the
application's modification, distribution, or commercial use of specific components.

#### Scalability
The application's architecture must support scalability to accommodate growing user numbers and data volumes, which may
necessitate additional investment in server infrastructure and database and application code optimisation.
