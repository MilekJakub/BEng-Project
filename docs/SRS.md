### Design and Implementation Constraints

The development and deployment of this application are subject to several constraints that could affect both its design
and implementation. These constraints are primarily related to system requirements, compliance standards, hardware
limitations, and specific technologies employed in the project.

#### Frontend Technologies
The use of React, Redux, and Tailwind CSS dictates a modern, component-based architecture for the frontend.
This choice necessitates the use of browsers that support ES6 and later features, potentially limiting support for
older browser versions.

#### Mobile Support
Initial exclusion of mobile platforms could constrain user accessibility and market reach, necessitating a responsive
design approach to somehow accommodate mobile devices.

#### Client Devices
The application's performance on client devices, especially in terms of graphics and real-time features
(Phaser, SignalR), may vary based on the device's hardware capabilities, such as GPU and CPU performance.

#### Content Licensing
The use of third-party assets or code libraries necessitates adherence to licensing agreements, which may restrict
the modification, distribution, or commercial use of certain components of the application.

#### Scalability
The application's architecture must support scalability to accommodate growing user numbers and data volumes, which may
necessitate additional investment in server infrastructure and optimization of database and application code.
