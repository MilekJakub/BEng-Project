# Application Features

## Onboarding
Guides the user through the process of creating their new identity, habits and a roadmap related to it.

## Identity
*"Identity is what you believe in."* ~ James Clear

*"With results-based habits, you focus on what you want to achieve. With identity-based habits, you focus on who you want to become."* ~ James Clear

*"The highest form of intrinsic motivation is to make a habit part of your identity. It’s quite different to say you’re the kind of person who wants something than to say you’re the kind of person who is something."* ~ James Clear

User can create their identity by answering questions:
- What are your goals?
- What type of person could achieve what I want?
- What does the person I described do?
- What does the person I described not do?

## Habits

*"The more often you repeat a behavior, the more you establish an identity associated with that behavior."*  ~ James Clear

*"You don’t just snap your fingers and decide to become a completely different person. You change a little at a time, day by day, habit by habit."* ~ James Clear

*"Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."* ~ James Clear

User can create habits based on their identity.

User can create habits based on the following questions:
- The most important thing that the person I described does is...
- How often does the person I described do this?
- How can I make this obvious?
- How can I make it attractive?
- How can I make it easy?
- How can I make it satisfying?

## Roadmap
The user can create a roadmap to achieve their goals.

User can create a roadmap by answering questions:
- The most important goal for me is... (goal)
- What are the most important things you need to be able to know / do to achieve this goal? (milestones)
- What you can do to achieve each milestone? (steps)
- What do you need to know / be able to do to complete the step? (branches)
