# Engineering Project

An online idle RPG game that facilitates learning and effective habit building.

## Introduction

The world is inexorably moving forward. There are more and more things weighing on our minds. Personal development is a key aspect in our lives. Based on current knowledge, we are able to describe what a habit is and how to develop it. This project is designed to build the habit of daily learning, which is key to achieving our goals.

## Atomic Habits by James Clear

[Atomic Habits Summary](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-summary)

The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.

The cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. 

How to create a good habit: 
- The 1st law (Cue): Make it obvious. 
- The 2nd law (Craving): Make it attractive. 
- The 3rd law (Response): Make it easy. 
- The 4th law (Reward): Make it satisfying.

## Okay, but what does this have to do with the game?
Why do I think that the game is the best tool for developing the habit of everyday learning?

Let's see...

### The 1st law (Cue)
The book clearly states:
- We cannot forget about our habits.
- It is very important to maintain a streak of performing the habit.
- Memory is unreliable and we need reminders.

The applications themselves remind you of their existence.
- Notifications are hard to miss because everyone has a phone at hand these days.
- Notifications do not disappear until we move them manually.
- Additionaly the game may have a daily streak, a heatmap (similar to GitHub), daily challenges and more.

These things make it difficult to forget about the game.

### The 2nd law (Craving)
Learning is boring because:
- We are overloaded with information.
- Learning is monotonous.
- Distractions everywhere.
- We do not know methods of effective learning.

Video games are fun because of:
- Interactivity
- Imagination
- Challenges and achievements
- Community and competition
- Storytelling

### The 3rd law (Response)
Learning is difficult because:
- No one taught us how to learn
- We have no motivation
- We feel pressure and stress
- We are too tired

How to learn new things?
- Learn using the Pomodoro technique
- Set small steps/achievements
- Set deadlines
- Be sure to take notes
- Follow Bloom's Teaching Taxonomy
- Create flashcards
- Learn by teaching others
- Use your knowledge in practice

Following these principles, I would like to create a game that will make learning as easy as possible.

### The 4th law (Reward)

Learning neither shows progress nor rewards us :(

We pass an exam, and then another exam, and then another...

We finally finish our education and get a reward in the form of a job...

This isn't fun.

If we want an achievement system, we have to build it ourselves.

But...

Progression and rewards are an integral part of games!

- Game progress is visible immediately.
- The games can be competitive.
- We are rewarded for pushing forward.
- The games are simply satisfying
